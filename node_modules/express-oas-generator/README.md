Module to:
* automatically generate OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for existing ExpressJS 4.x REST API applications;
* provide Swagger UI basing on generated specification.


## How to use

* Install module `npm i express-oas-generator --save`;
* Import in script where you initialize ExpressJS application;
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const expressOasGenerator = require('express-oas-generator');
```
* Run initialization of module right after instantiating app;
```javascript
let app = express();
expressOasGenerator.init(app, {}); // to overwrite generated specification's values use second argument.

```
* **Important!** In order to get description of all parameters and JSON payloads you have to start using your REST API or run REST API tests against it so module can analyze requests/responses
* Assuming you running your app on port 8000
    * open [http://localhost:8000/api-docs](http://localhost:8000/api-docs) to see Swagger UI for your REST API
    * specification file is available  [http://localhost:8000/api-spec](http://localhost:8000/api-spec) - link is prepended to description field
    
Second argument of `expressOasGenerator.init(app, {})` could be either an object or a function. In case of the object generated spec will be merged with the object. In case of function it will be used to apply changes for generated spec. Example of function usage:
```javascript
generator.init(app, function(spec) {
    _.set(spec, 'info.title', 'New Title');
    _.set(spec, 'paths[\'/path\'].get.parameters[0].example', 2);
    return spec;
});

```

To write specification into a file use third and forth (optional) arguments:
```javascript
expressOasGenerator.init(
  app,
  function(spec) { return spec; },
  'path/to/a/file/filename.json',
  60 * 1000
)
```
where:
* 'path/to/a/file/filename.json' - path to a file and file name
* 60 * 1000 - write interval in milliseconds (optional parameter, by default interval is equal to 10 seconds)

## (Optional) Additions to your package.json

If your service is running not at the root of the server add full base path URL to package.json

```json 
{
  "baseUrlPath" : "/tokens"
}
```

Here is a sample
```json 
{
  "name": "cwt-sts-svc",
  "version": "1.1.48",
  "description": "JWT generation service",
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "main": "lib",
  "baseUrlPath" : "/tokens",
  "bin": {
    "cwt-sts-svc": "bin/server"
  }
```

## Rationale

Goal of the module is to provide developers with Swagger UI in development environments. Module process every request and response therefore it may slow down your app - is not supposed to be used in production environment.

Assuming you have ExpressJS REST API application and you
* don't want to write documentation manually;
* but want to use Swagger ecosystem:
  * keep REST API endpoint documented;
  * provide others with Swagger UI to your REST API;
  * generate client libraries for it with Swagger code generator.

## How does it work

1. During initialization module iterates through all routes and methods and initializes OpenAPI (Swagger) specification.
2. After an application start module analyze every request/response and fills specification with schemes and examples.
3. Module replace values of password fields with `******`

## Limitations

1. All headers with prefix `X-` treated as a apiKey type headers;
2. Module doesn't recognize enumerations in JSON objects;
